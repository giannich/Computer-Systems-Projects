# Computer-Systems-Projects

Readme still WIP, need to add:

- Compilation/Interpreting instructions
- Source of exercises
- Testing utilites

The three main Assembler/Compiler projects are as follows:

- JackCompiler compiles .jack files into .vm files
- VMTranslate compiles .vm files into .asm files
- Assembler compiles .asm files into .hack files

Jack is a programming language similar to Java, which is compiled into intermediate virtual machine code, and finally into assembly. 
The assembler finally compiles the assembly code into its respective machine code representation.

The Systems HW0 is just a python script that removes comments.
